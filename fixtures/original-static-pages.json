            "body": "crowd.loc.gov provides students of all ages with opportunities to explore unique historical documents from the collections of the Library of Congress.\n\nDeciphering and transcribing these documents can build students\u2019 skills in close reading, examining historical context, and building interpretive consensus.\n\n## Teaching Ideas\n\n- As students transcribe a document, urge them to pay close attention to the language used in the document. What does that language tell them about who the audience for the document was? Was it a close friend or family member? A powerful person? A complete stranger? If the document is a letter, what clues can they find in the greeting and closing?\n\n- Prompt students to speculate about what the document\u2019s author was trying to accomplish. What strategies, persuasive or otherwise, did the author use to accomplish their goal?\n\n- Challenge students to recreate the document in their own words, using today\u2019s communication tools. What did your students say differently? What did they say that was the same?\n\n- Ask students to identify clues about the time and place in which the document was created. What do they know about what was going on at the time? How can they find out more? \n\n- Ask students to research and describe what happened as a result of this document being created. If they can\u2019t identify what happened, ask them to speculate about what might have happened as a result of the document.\n\n- As students complete the transcription-reconciliation process, encourage them to take note of the ways they compared the differences between different transcriptions of the same document. What similarities and differences can they find between this process and the process of evaluating sources for a class project or research paper?\n\n## Primary Source Analysis\n\nThe documents in crowd.loc.gov are _primary sources_ \u2014 the raw materials of history and culture. Analyzing primary sources like these can give students a powerful sense of the complexity of the past, and can guide them toward higher-order thinking and better critical thinking skills.\n\nUse the Library\u2019s [primary source analysis tool and teacher\u2019s guide to analyzing manuscripts](http://www.loc.gov/teachers/usingprimarysources/guides.html) to guide your students through an analysis of any of the documents in crowd.loc.gov.\n\n**A note about content**: The historical documents in the Library\u2019s collections may include language or topics that aren\u2019t appropriate for your students, or that your students might find especially difficult to engage with. You may want to review documents before assigning them, or to use some of the strategies explored here.\n\n## Campaign Specific Resources\n\n### Letters to Lincoln (Featured Challenge for 2018!)\n\n- [\"I Do Solemnly Swear...\"  Presidential Inaugurations](https://www.loc.gov/rr/program/bib/inaugurations/index.html)\n- [The Library of Congress Celebrates the Songs of America](https://www.loc.gov/collections/songs-of-america/about-this-collection/)\n- [Additional Primary Materials](http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/primarysourcesets/lincoln/)\n\n### Branch Rickey: Changing the Game\n\n- Lesson Plan: [Baseball, Race and Ethnicity: Rounding the Bases](http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/lessons/bases/)\n- Lesson Plan: [Baseball, Race Relations and Jackie Robinson](http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/lessons/robinson/)\n- Primary Source Set: [Baseball Across a Divided Society](http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/primarysourcesets/baseball/)\n\n### Civil War Soldiers: \"Disabled but not disheartened\"\n\n- Lesson plan: [The Civil War Through a Child's Eye](http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/lessons/childs-eye/)\n- Teacher's guide: [The Civil War: The Nation Moves Towards War, 1850-61](http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/primarysourcesets/civil-war-approach/)\n\n### Clara Barton: \"Angel of the Battlefield\"\n\n- [Clara Barton Missing Soldiers Office Museum External additional resources](http://www.clarabartonmuseum.org/learn/studentresearch/)\n\n### Mary Church Terrell: Advocate for African Americans and Women\n\n- Lesson plan: [Suffrage Strategies: Voices for Votes](http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/lessons/suffrage/)\n- [http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/lessons/strivings/](http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/lessons/strivings/)\n- [Votes for Women: Selections from the National American Woman Suffrage Association Collection, 1848 to 1921](https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/connections/votes-women/)\n- [Civil Rights, information for Students](http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/themes/civil-rights/students.html)\n- [From Slavery to Civil Rights: A Timeline of African American History](https://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/presentationsandactivities/presentations/civil-rights/) \n- [Segregation: From Jim Crow to Linda Brown](http://www.loc.gov/teachers/classroommaterials/lessons/jimcrow/)",

The Library of Congress will mark the 155th anniversary of this historic speech with a one-day celebration, featuring an exhibition of the earliest known draft of the speech, and a Letters to Lincoln Challenge transcribe-a-thon for volunteers on and off site!\n\n### Schedule\n\n-   08:30am Jefferson Building doors open!\n-   10:00am Welcome remarks by Dr. Carla Hayden, 14th Librarian of Congress\n-   10:05am Special talk about the background of the Gettysburg Address by historian and curator Michelle Krowl\n-   10:15am Gettysburg Address delivered by student orator Christian Melgar\n-   10:25am Details of the Letters to Lincoln Challenge for onsite and remote participants\n-   10:30am Nicolay copy of the Gettysburg Address unveiled \n-   10:35am Letters to Lincoln Challenge transcribe-a-thon begins \n-   10:35am-1:30pm Letters to Lincoln Challenge Transcribe-a-thon\n-   4:30pm Jefferson Building doors close for the day \n\n#### In the area on November 19th?\n\nJoin us in the Great Hall of the Jefferson Building (Library of Congress) to have the rare opportunity to see the Nicolay copy of the Gettysburg Address in person. Dr. Hayden will kick things off at 10am, followed by a reading of the Address by a student orator, and a special talk about Lincoln and the Gettysburg Address, by historian and curator Michelle Krowl. After the Gettysburg Address is revealed at 10:30 various hands on transcription and learning opportunities will be available. \n\n#### Off site but online?\n\nWe\u2019ll livestream the Librarian and curator\u2019s talks, and the reading of the Gettysburg address from 10:00-10:30 [via this link](https://www.youtube.com/loc). After that people at the Library and online can participate in the #LettersToLincoln challenge right here on [crowd.loc.gov](/campaigns/letters-to-lincoln/)! Choose an item from the Letters to Lincoln Campaign to transcribe, review, and/or tag. So far we've made material from the 1830s through 1850s available, but for our transcribe-a-thon we'll release materials from 1860, 1861, and 1862, spanning part of the Civil War and important moments in Lincoln's career and the history of the nation. Join in the discussion on [History Hub](https://historyhub.history.gov/community/crowd-loc) and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Crowd_LOC)! \n\nYou can [check in live](https://historyhub.history.gov/community/crowd-loc/blog/2018/11/14/transcribe-with-us-nov-19-the-155th-anniversary-of-the-gettysburg-address) with a Community Manager on History Hub throughout the transcribe-a-thon from 10:30am to 1:30pm EST. \n\n#### Opportunities for students near and far\n\nTune in at 10:00am for the livestream or join us in person to see the Gettysburg address, hear talks, and do some hands on activities and online transcriptions. Students onsite or in their own classrooms will be invited to transcribe, tag, and review documents received by Abraham Lincoln throughout his career. You can transcribe as a group or challenge your students to transcribe on their own or in pairs. All transcriptions are reviewed by at least one other volunteer, so don't be shy to try! If you or your students are finding it hard to read something, try finding something to review first. This is a great way to \"get your eye in\" and learn from others how to read these original documents.\n\nTo confirm participation for your class or students, please e-mail the Community Managers at [crowd@loc.gov](mailto:crowd@loc.gov) for further instructions. [Visit History Hub](https://historyhub.history.gov/community/crowd-loc/blog/2018/11/14/transcribe-with-us-nov-19-the-155th-anniversary-of-the-gettysburg-address) for your transcribe-a-thon pack including details on how to take part. \n\n## Letters to Lincoln Challenge\n\n---\n\n![Cover of yellow envelope with drawn portrait of Lincoln in the top left corner and a depiction of Lincoln chopping wood in the middle](/static/img/LincolnCampaign.jpg)\n\n### Help us transcribe 10,000+ items from the Abraham Lincoln Papers by the end of 2018!\n\n#### A grand challenge: why we're asking you to join us\n\nAround half of the digitized Abraham Lincoln Papers, primarily materials written by Lincoln, have been transcribed by other volunteers at Knox College and elsewhere, and are already keyword searchable at loc.gov. However, there remain 10,000+ items including letters and other materials sent to him that are not yet keyword searchable. Completing the [Letters to Lincoln Challenge](https://crowd.loc.gov/campaigns/letters-to-lincoln/) will make all of the digital Lincoln Papers word-searchable and accessible to future readers. Just imagine the possibilities--from new research to local connections--that will be possible once we've achieved this goal. Thank you in advance for sharing your time with us. Your Community Managers, reference librarians and curatorial staff here at the Library of Congress will be cheering you on with bonus historical context and resources all along the way, as well as some special rewards for goals met!\n\nCan you transcribe even just one letter and share the challenge with one friend to help push toward our goal? When the project completes we\u2019ll move onto the next exciting decade of Lincoln's life, the 1850s when he returned to politics.\n\n#### What are the Letters to Lincoln?\n\nYou might guess that the Abraham Lincoln Papers include materials written in his own hand, but did you know the collection contains correspondence sent to Abraham Lincoln throughout his life and political career? Here's a taste of what you'll find: a range of materials by writers ranging from friends and associates from Lincoln\u2019s Springfield days, well-known political figures and reformers, constituents writing to their President, and even the occasional document in Lincoln's own hand. Read the concerns and requests of nineteenth-century Americans and international correspondents.\n\n## Library of Congress News\n\n---\n\nEnabling Discovery of unique treasures at the Library of Congress [Press release](https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-18-134/crowdsourcing-tool-enables-discovery-of-unique-treasures-at-the-library-of-congress/2018-10-24/)\n\nAnnouncing crowd.loc.gov: [Here we go!](https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2018/10/lets-go-explore-transcribe-and-tag-at-crowd-loc-gov/)\n\n[Connecting crowdsourcing](https://blogs.loc.gov/thesignal/2018/10/new-strategy-new-crowd-new-team/) to the new Library of Congress 2019-2023 Strategic Plan and Digital Strategy\n\n## Press coverage\n\n---\n\nMental Floss - 28 October 2018 - [The Library of Congress Needs Help Transcribing Lincoln's Letters and Other Historic Documents](http://mentalfloss.com/article/561842/library-congress-needs-help-transcribing-lincolns-letters-and-other-historic)",

Our goal is to make documents word-searchable in the Library of Congress catalog, which means typing transcriptions that can be read by that computer system, as well as by humans. Most handwriting and some typed text cannot be automatically and accurately translated into machine-readable text using current technologies -- that\u2019s why we need your help!\n</p>\n<p>\nWe ask you to transcribe a document roughly as it appears on the page. Preserve line breaks, except in cases where words are broken over two lines. Our main goal is to capture all of the words on these pages, so broken words are not helpful for search. Using line breaks to roughly capture the layout of the page helps reviewers (other volunteers) check transcriptions. These will be viewable beside the original images in the catalog, so anyone who is interested in the physical layout of the original document will be able to see it.\n</p>\n\n<h3>All in order:</h3>\n<p>\nTranscribe text in the order it appears.\n</p>\n<h3>\nSpelling:\n</h3>\n<p>\nPreserve original spelling unless the author seems to have made a minor error, such as writing \u201cteh\u201d instead of \u201cthe\u201d. If a misspelling will impact the searchability of the document, use a tag to add the correct spelling. Example:\n<ul>\n<li>  An author wrote \u201cWilla Kather\u201d instead of \u201cWilla Cather\u201d. Transcribe Willa Kather, and tag \u201cWilla Cather\u201d. </li>\n</ul>\n</p>\n\n<h3>Insertions:</h3>\n<p>\nWhen text has been inserted or added later, but should be read as part of a sentence, bring it down into the line and type it in the order you would read it aloud.\n</p>\n<h3>\nLine-breaks:</h3>\n<p>\nDo not reproduce words broken between two lines. Write library rather than li-brary, kitten rather than kit-ten. Otherwise hit \"enter\" or \"return\" at the end of a line, to roughly mirror the layout of the original document. This will help reviewers in crowd.loc.gov to easily compare your transcription with the image.\n</p>\n<h3>\nEmphasis:\n</h3>\n<p>\nThe Library catalog cannot search for bold, italic, underlined or superscript text, so even when you see these features please transcribe the words without any styling.\n</p>\n<h3>\nIllegible:\n</h3>\n<p>\nIllegible text is anything you can\u2019t read because a page is damaged, text is heavily crossed out or you can\u2019t tell what the author has written. If there is a word or a string of words you cannot read use a pair of square brackets around an empty space [ ]. Example:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>  \"I have [ ] loved coffee ice cream\" </li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIf you can read any letters or parts of words transcribe what you can and use question marks for the remaining letters or words. Examples:\n</p>\n<ul>\n<li>  \"I have [a?????] loved coffee ice cream\"</li>\n<li>   \"I have [a?] loved coffee ice cream\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\nIf you cannot read a word or phrase that\u2019s ok. Another volunteer may be able to identify the missing letters and update your transcription. If there is a lot of text you cannot read consider looking for another page that you can decipher better.\n</p>\n<h3>Deletions:</h3>\n<p>\nIf you can read crossed out or otherwise deleted text, transcribe the deleted words within a pair of square brackets. Example:\n</p>\n<ul><li>  \u201cI have always loved [vanilla] coffee ice cream.\u201d </li></ul>\n\n<h3>Marginalia:</h3>\n\n<p>\nMarginalia is text written in the space around the main block of text. It is usually a comment on the main body text but can also be unrelated. It is different from an insertion, because it cannot be directly inserted into the main text and still make sense when read aloud. Use a pair of square brackets and asterisk [*] around marginalia text and order it within the transcription where it makes the most sense (or at the end of the transcription if it appears unrelated). Example:\n</p>\n<ul><li>\n   I have always loved coffee ice cream. Last summer I made my own using a recipe from the 1970s. It was the creamiest coffee ice cream I ever ate. No one else in my family likes that flavor. Oh well, more for me! [*Brazil was the largest coffee producing country in the world in 2017*]</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>Printed and typed text:</h3>\n<p>\nSome material in crowd.loc.gov was created on a typewriter or printed. If we have included it here it is because the text is not machine-readable. A computer using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology cannot create an accurate word-searchable transcription. Examples include the scouting reports of Branch Rickey, which are typed on thin paper and are often too fuzzy for successful OCR. Similarly, mixed materials containing manuscript and print have not been run through OCR, so please transcribe letterhead and any other printed features that will shed light on where a document was created.\n</p>\n\n<h3>When not to transcribe printed text:</h3>\n<p>\nSome calendars and diaries contain many pages of pre-printed almanacs or other text that is probably machine-readable and therefore should not be transcribed as part of this project. It might be interesting to copy the first page from a repeating template in a diary or journal, but this is not the core text we are aiming to capture. However, if you want to transcribe it, feel free. Alternatively, click \"Nothing to transcribe\". This button should also be used for archival folders, blank pages, and pictorial images.\n</p>\n    \n<h3>Tables, graphics, images:</h3>\n<p>\nSome documents will contain tables. Transcribe these in a way that will make them relatively easy for a reviewer to check over, but don't try to capture the exact layout of the data. The material will go back into the catalog without styling. Don't include notes or descriptions of visual features. If you would like to describe images, watermarks, stamps, or any other non-text features, feel free to use the tagging function.
