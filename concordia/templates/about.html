                <p>We, the people, have a vision for a Library transcription and tagging tool to empower you, the user, to interact with historic materials in new ways. While typeset text can be scanned by optical character recognition software (OCR), to quickly and inexpensively add full text search capability, there’s no simple way to do that for hand-written diaries, journals, manuscripts, un-tagged photographs of this kind, or other primary source material of that ilk.</p>
                <p>Making these items searchable is a time-consuming, laborious process. By transcribing and tagging, we can describe each item in a collection or catalog and make it machine-readable, where traditional indexing methods don’t exactly scale well in the digital age when the source material is hand-written. Our hope at the Library is that by providing digital stewardship, open source work flows can be managed by a mix of volunteers and Library editors. Ultimately, by openly sourcing this work and attaching your contributions to each historic artifact, we can preserve these chronicles and users can search and find artifacts based upon the added text.</p>
                <p>We’re also hoping to attract people interested in conversations and discussion related to collections, similar to the way genealogy and ancestry sites enrich the lives of those seeking connections and pathways to their ethnic lineage and family histories.</p>
                <p>By volunteering your time to help make these materials more accessible, participants can get credit, discover, and learn about our Nation’s chroniclers and trailblazers. The heritage engrained in these documents is evident as you begin to uncover and weave your way through the labyrinth that accompanies and joins each piece of work.</p>
                <p>So, we welcome you to this effort. Help us help others—from novelist to blogger, publisher to researcher, and the world at large—by preserving, digitizing, and making these original works of American authors Internet-ready and time tested.</p>
                <p>Anyone is welcome to contribute to the site, anonymously or as a registered user, and no special expertise is required. For transcribing and tagging documents, registration is encouraged but not required. You may create an account here, especially if you wish to track your contributions, get email alerts and updates, and contribute to conversations. Thank you for participating.</p>
                <p>Power to the people.</p>
