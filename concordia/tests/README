This directory contains test for the concordia app. It has a combination of django TestCases (which will create a
test database before running each test), and pyunit test.

To run these tests in the concordia app,

To run all tests:
python manage.py test concordia - runs all unit tests

To run a single unittest module:
python manage.py test concordia.tests.test_view - runs all the tests in test_view.py

To run a single unittest in a django unittest module:
python manage.py test concordia.tests.test_view.ViewTest1.test_addition  - runs the test_addition test in test_view.py

Regarding django TestCases, since these tests create a test database, the docker container with the db must be running.
This is run as "docker-compose up db"
