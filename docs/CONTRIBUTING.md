### Write Documentation

Concordia could always use more documentation. If you have worked with the tool and found any of our documentation to be inaccurate or vague, please submit an issue or a pull request.

### How to submit Feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/concordia/issues.

If you are proposing a feature:

-   Explain in detail how it would work.
-   Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
-   Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that contributions
    are welcome :)

## Contributing Changes

If you have work which you would like to share with the main project, GitHub has
a [guide for creating pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)
as part of their broader help site, which also includes instructions for performing
common tasks using the Git command-line interface or various desktop interfaces.

### Pull Request Guidelines

Before you submit a pull request, check that it meets these guidelines:

1. You should be able and willing to release your code under the same terms as
   the top-level LICENSE file
1. The pull request should include tests.
1. If the pull request adds functionality it should be described at a technical
   level in the code and and user-visible changes should be described in the
   main README
