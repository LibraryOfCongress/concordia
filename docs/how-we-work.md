# How We Work

## Principles

Our basic principles are those familiar to anybody who has contributed to a prominent open source project, or deployed code in a modern software environment:

-   We produce open source software, created and maintained in repositories where it may be inspected by the public who places their trust in it and copied for use by other agencies or institutions.
-   We adhere to the basic practices of agile software development, using the Scrum development framework.
-   We practice human-centered design. Everything that we produce is highly accessible, per [WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).
-   Finally, we believe in having the relevant decision-makers at the table during all meetings, to maximize efficiency and maintain momentum.

## Product Team

This is a cross functional product team for Concordia made up of members across the Library who are working together. This product team will be comprised of the following roles:

-   Product owner
-   Product manager (Scrum master)
-   Technical lead
-   User Experience designer
-   Developers (Front-end, Back-end, Full-stack)
-   QA Tester
-   Community Managers (content writers, administrators)

This team participates in stand ups, product alignment, backlog grooming and retrospectives in service of prioritizing, defining and delivering value to the department and the public it serves.

## Sprint Organization and Meetings

Each sprint is three weeks long. We have a sprint kick off the first day of the new sprint. There are five basic meeting rhythms:

-   **Backlog grooming and Sprint Planning Monday at 1:00 â€“ 3:30 pm**
    -   Structure: tickets in the backlog are sorted by priority, the team adds acceptance criteria, estimates size, and assigns the tasks to a team member.
-   **Demo and retrospectives are held on every three weeks on Monday at 1:00 - 2:00 pm**
    -   At the end of each sprint, Developers or content writers demo completed work in the sprint for the larger library stakeholders. During demo, we will confirm if the user acceptance criteria is met and moved to be tested. Following the demo, the team will go through a retrospective. These are held back-to-back, on the same day

All meetings are held in person, on Slack or WebEx, a video teleconference application.

## Definition of Done

So that we can work more efficiently and be confident in the quality of the work we are delivering, we have a clear definition of what it means for a user story to be done, or production-ready.

**For delivering a user story to the product team:**

-   Story needs to be written in a way that is clear from both a development and a testing standpoint. Stories will need to be reviewed by the product team during creation.
-   Acceptance criteria should include the relevant tests needed (unit, security, performance, acceptance, etc)
-   Acceptance criteria should include the objective of the story, for use in approval by PO or tech team or both
-   The delivered functionality should match the acceptance criteria of the user story

**for product team to accept the user story and ship it:**

-   The functionality meets the acceptance criteria
-   The product team has verified the functionality in staging
-   All tests must pass in the the stage environment (unit, integration, feature)
-   The delivered functionality should be 508 compliant
-   Security requirements must be met
-   All documentation must be up to date (diagrams, training documentation, API documentation, help text, etc)
-   The delivered functionality should be compatible with the latest versions of Firefox, Chrome and Safari

## Processes

### Testing Strategy

We practice testing at three levels: unit tests, integration tests, and feature tests. For details about how we create and maintain unit, integration and feature tests.

-   Unit - Unit tests must be created for all new code, during the sprint in which the code is written, with coverage of at least 90%.
-   Integration - Code must include tests that verify that interfaces are functioning as designed.
-   Feature - New features must have functional definitions of the thing that they are to perform, and a description of human-performable actions to verify that they perform that thing.

#### Testing new code

Each ticket will include acceptance tests, especially for new user facing functionality. When the developer signals that the ticket is ready for test, they will move it to the `Needs test` column and pings the tester in the comment of the ticket.

Testers will identify issues - HIGH, LOW, or NONE. Here are the criteria for each of the levels:

-   HIGH: Does not meet the acceptace criteria and can not complete the acceptance test.
-   LOW: Does meet both acceptace criteria and and acceptance tests, but can see opportunities for enhancements.
-   NONE: Meets both accpetance criteria and acceptance tests

If all user acceptance criteria has been met, the ticket will be closed and moved to done.

Final step: Technical lead will create a release with all tickets that are done.

**How to provide feedback**

If feature testers find issues to address:

-   HIGH: comment and @ the developer in the feature ticket
-   LOW: open a new FEATURE ticket. This ticket will be added to the backlog and up for priortization in alignment meeting and backlog grooming. Link to related ticket by adding the issue #.

If a HIGH issue needs to be addressed, tester should expect to be available to respond to developers questions and retest until acceptance criteria is met.

### Branch strategy and Pull Request Process

#### Git branching strategy

We have two long-lived git branches, `master` and `release`.

The `master` branch continuously deploys to our development environment.

The `release` branch continuously deploys to our staging environment.
Our development and staging environments are on AWS and only accessible through the Library's network.

##### Starting new work

When someone begins new work, they cut a new branch from `master` and name it after their work, perhaps `feature1`. New changes are pushed to the feature branch origin.

##### Merging to `master`

When new work is complete, we set up a Pull Request (PR) from `feature1` to `master`. Discussion about, and approval of changes by either the Technical Lead, Product Owner or both happens in the PR interface in GitHub.

Once this new work is approved we merge the code, which closes the PR.
From here, our CI pipeline will build the new changes on the `master` branch. Next, our CD pipeline will deploy the new work to our development environment.

##### Merging to `release`

Once the development work on a sprint is completed, we set up a PR from `master` to `release`.

This constitutes a new release candidate. Any last-minute discussion, as well as approval happens in the PR interface. Once approved by the Technical Lead, Product Owner or both and merged, CI runs for `release` branch to the staging environment.

##### Tagging and deploying to production

When the `release` branch has been fully tested in the staging environment, we create a GitHub release with a tag on the `release` branch.

Either trigger a Jenkins build manually or wait for continuous integration for the `release` branch to kick in. This will build a cleanly tagged versioned release candidate and upload the docker images to Amazon Elastic Container Registry.

To deploy to production, create a new task revision for the `concordia-prod` task which updates the version numbers of the docker containers to match the recently built cleanly tagged release candidate. Update the production service to use the new task definition revision. Monitor the health check endpoint to ensure the service is updated to the proper version.

##### Patching production mid-sprint

If a problem is identified in production that needs a quick fix, we code the fix to production in a new branch cut from `release`, maybe called `prod_fix`. We set up a PR against `release` for review and discussion.

Any QA or manual testing will take place in the staging environment deployed from the `release` branch. Once the release is tagged and deployed to production, we have to bring those new changes in release back into master. We use rebase again: `git rebase master release`.

### Code quality and review process

Code reviews are about keeping code clean and limiting technical debt. We will look for things that increase technical debt or create an environment where technical debt can be introduced easily later. Each pull request will be reviewed by the technical lead or assigned reviewer. As a reviewer, they will look closely for untested code, if there are tests that they are testing what they're supposed to, that they are following the Library's code standards.

### Ensuring your work follows the Library's coding standards

The project extends the standard Django settings model for project configuration and the Django test framework for unit tests.

#### Configuring your virtual env

The easiest way to install the site is using [Pipenv](https://pipenv.readthedocs.io/) to manage the virtual environment and install dependencies.

#### Configure your local checkout with code-quality hooks

1.  Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
1.  Run `pre-commit install`

Now every time you make a commit in Git the various tools listed in the next
section will automatically run and report any problems.

n.b. Each time you check out a new copy of this Git repository, run `pre-commit install`.

#### Configure your editor with helpful tools:

[setup.cfg](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/concordia/blob/master/setup.cfg) contains configuration for [pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/), [isort](https://pypi.org/project/isort/) and [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/).

Configure your editor to run black and isort on each file at save time.

1.  Install [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) and integrate it with your editor of choice.
2.  Run [flake8](http://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) to ensure you don't increase the warning count or introduce errors with your commits.
3.  This project uses [EditorConfig](https://editorconfig.org) for code consistency.

If you can't modify your editor, here is how to run the code quality
tools manually:

```
    $ black .
    $ isort --recursive
```

Black should be run prior to isort. It's recommended to commit your code
before running black, after running black, and after running isort so
the changes from each step are visible.

## Tools we use

-   GitHub - We use our GitHub organization for storing both software and collaboratively-maintained text.
-   Slack - We use the Slack for communication that falls outside of the structure of Jira or GitHub, but that doesnâ€™t rise to the level of email, or for communication that itâ€™s helpful for everybody else to be able to observe.
-   WebEx - We use WebEx for video conferencing in all our meetings
