# inside your current folder and that it has been populated with the following content:
#   CONCORDIA_ADMIN_PW=<concordia-admin-pw>
#   POSTGRESQL_PW=<postgres-pw>
#   EMAIL_HOST=<your_smtp_email_host_here>
#   EMAIL_HOST_USER=<your_smtp_email_host_user_here>
#   EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD=<your_smtp_email_host_password_here>
#   DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=<your_email_from_address_here>
