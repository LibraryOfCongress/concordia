# Welcome to Concordia

Concordia is a platform developed by the Library of Congress (LOC) for crowdsourcing transcription and tagging of text in digitized images with the dual goals of collection enhancement and public engagement. Concordia is a user-centered project centering the principles of trust and approachability. [Read our full design principles here](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/concordia/blob/master/docs/design-principles.md). Learn more about the Concordia development process in [this Code4Lib article](https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/14901).

LOC launched the first iteration of Concordia as [By the People at crowd.loc.gov](https://crowd.loc.gov/) in October 2018. 

The Library of Congress publishes transcriptions created by By the People volunteers on [loc.gov](https://www.loc.gov/) to improve search, readability, and access to handwritten and typed documents. Individual transcriptions are published alongside the transcribed images in digital collections and transcriptions are also published in bulk as [datasets](https://www.loc.gov/search/?fa=contributor:by+the+people+%28program%29). [Learn more about how we publish transcriptions](https://blogs.loc.gov/folklife/2022/05/etl-searching-the-lomax-family-papers-through-the-magic-of-crowdsourcing/).

Concordia code and the By the People transcriptions are released into the public domain. Anyone is free to use or reuse the data. [More info on our licensing page](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/concordia/blob/main/LICENSE.md).

As of May 2022 the Library of Congress Concordia development team has moved issues out of Github to an internal system due to reporting needs.  Open github issue tickets may not be active or up-to-date. We continue to publish our code here as it is released. Learn more about [How We Work](https://github.com/LibraryOfCongress/concordia/blob/main/docs/how-we-work.md).

_Concordia and By the People are supported by the National Digital Library Trust Fund._

## What Concordia does

The application invites volunteers to transcribe and tag digitized images of manuscript and typed materials from the Libraryâ€™s collections. All transcriptions are made by volunteers and reviewed by volunteers. It takes at least one volunteer to transcribe a page and at least one other volunteer to review and mark it complete. Some complex documents may pass through both transcription and review many times before they are accepted as complete by a volunteer. 

Concordia is a containerized Python-Django-Postgres-etc web application. The Library hosts its instance in the cloud.

Concordia leverages the publicly-available [loc.gov API](https://libraryofcongress.github.io/data-exploration/) to call collection metadata and images in JPEG format and save copies for use in Concordia. Completed transcriptions can be exported out of the application as a single CSV or individual TXT files in a BagIt bag.
